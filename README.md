# Hello, World! Animator

This GUI-based program allows a user to create ,remove, and animate text objects reading "Hello, World!". When animating, these text objects move around the window, appearing to bounce
off the edges of the window. This animation continues until stopped by the user. To create a new text object, click the "Add Text" button in the upper-left corner of the window. Similarly, clicking "Remove Text" 
will remove every text object from the window.

To run the program, clone this repository and make sure that you have Go (found [here](https://go.dev/dl/)) installed on your machine. Once Go is installed, run *go run .* in the parent directory to start the program.
